1. Interpretation of Sort Merge Join
   The Sort merge join contains the following steps.

   First, the edges from the given database are classified into
   three groups according to their labels. The groups of edges are stored as three new databases.

   Then, we iterate every edges in the first group and second group to store the edges from second group that satisfy
   firstEdge.to = secondEdge.from into a new database. The process is achieved in the
   *connectEdges(const SMDB *first_edges, const SMDB *second_edges) function. We firstly sort the left edges
   by 'to' values and the second edges by 'from' values in ascending order. We implement our own quick sort
   function, which can be check at quickSort(Edge_table **arr, int low, int high, int attribute). Because the join
   attributes are not unique here, we loop every left edges that has a 'to' value that equals the 'from' value of
   current right edges.

   We store the count of matches in the max_size of the new result database, and also the edges of matching from
   the second edges group. We repeat the above step with the previous result and the third edge group to get the new
   database. The final result will be the max_size of the database.

   There are two new struc created for the sort merge join. One is struct Edge_tuple. It has three attributes: label_edge,
   from_node and to_node. It is also used in Hash join. The other one is called struc SMDB, which stand for "Sort merge
   database". It records the all the edges inserted in the database, which is stored as an array of struct Edge_tuple in
   edges attributes. Another two attributes are size and max_size which are actual size of edges and the totalNumberOfEdgesInTheEnd.
   The max_size is also used to record the count of matching in the merge process, as mentioned before.

Generally speaking,sort merge joins are faster and uses less memory than hash joins. The sort join has a complexity of
O(n^2) + O(m^2) + O(m*n) in the worst case, where n is the size of the left relation and m is the size of the right
relation. The previous O(n^2) + O(m^2) are the complexity of the quick sort process and the O(m*n) is the merge
process. Because the index increases once the matching is found, every tuple in the right relation only goes through once.
In the worst case, every tuples in the right relation goes through the whole left relation. Hence,O(m+n) in the worst case.
